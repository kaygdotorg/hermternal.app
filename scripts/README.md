# Scripts

This directory contains small, deterministic repository tools. The roadmap
validator is a planning-only source check; it does not contact GitHub, Paper,
Hermes, or any other service.

## Roadmap template validator

Run it from the repository root:

```text
python3 scripts/validate_roadmap_template.py
```

Pass another local file when testing a mutation:

```text
python3 scripts/validate_roadmap_template.py path/to/roadmap.md
```

The command reads bytes, rejects invalid UTF-8, accepts a consistent LF or CRLF
style, and emits one JSON object. Invalid input exits non-zero and reports
stable error codes with one-based line numbers. The contract covers the exact
front matter, ten ordered H2 sections, required subsections and fields, the
canonical Paper URL, the `text` verification fence, and twelve ordered
unchecked definition-of-done items.

`test_validate_roadmap_template.py` runs the checked-in template plus 14
mutation families covering missing, duplicate, reordered, unknown, malformed,
checked, line-ending, and invalid-UTF-8 cases. Keep fixtures synthetic and
local. Do not add live Hermes calls, credentials, cookies, WebSocket tickets,
transcripts, provider data, secrets, hostnames, user data, or deployment
configuration to a script or test.

Keep the product milestone `v0.0.1` separate from date-based git tags
`vYYYY.MM.DD.<patch-num>`.
